                  People responded to a <strong>high volume</strong> of questions, and no one
                  in the focus groups suggested that the volume was too high.
                  In fact, some suggested that it would be better to ask even
                  more frequently:  "Yeah, the how do you feel right now and
                  what are you doing right now, that <strong>could be asked a bit more
                    frequently</strong>." &mdash;p18

                    Burden typically increases over time, but we found evidence that it was
                    decreasing for some of our users.  We asked what it was like when responding became
                    routine and got positive sentiments like this:

                    Response times were <strong>fast</strong>.  The average response time (from
                    presentation of the question to completing an answer) was 5.68
                    seconds.  In fact, this response time did not differ significantly
                    from the average time it took users to <strong>unlock their phones</strong>.
