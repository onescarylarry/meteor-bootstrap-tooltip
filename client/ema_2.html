        <!-- <p>
          Even though researchers are starting to use facial expressions, heart rate,
          and typing velocity to measure emotion, there's no better way to get the "hedonic"
          quality of someone's emotion than asking them.  There's a good reason to ask
          very frequently too.  Time patterns in emotion are a key indicator of instability
          and disordered mood (think bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder).
          Because  <span data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="More than half
          of college students felt 'overwhelming anxiety' in 2012.  That year, half reported
          greater than average or extreme levels of stress.">college students face enhanced
          risk for emotional problems</span>, we focused on measuring the time course
          of their emotions.  Doing this well is crucial from a clinical and public health
          pespective.
        </p> -->

        <p>
          Emotions occur in a variety of environments and circumstances.
          To understand the effect of these changes, we need to <strong>measure emotion
          in different contexts</strong>.  If contexts change frequently, emotion must
          be reported frequently.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's normal for emotions to fluctuate.  However, very rapid and extreme fluctuations
          can signal problems with regulating emotions (such as bipolar disorder or borderline
          personality disorder).  These <strong>insights from emotion dynamics</strong> require that
          a person report frequently enough to capture the patterns accurately.

        <h3>Frequency is Elusive</h3>
        <p>
          Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is one name for the technique of answering
          a question repeatedly over time.  It's easy to see how that experience
          can <strong>become a burden</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this project, we broke burden down into three components:
          <ul>
            <li>interruption: is focus being disrupted?</li>
            <li>effort: how many steps required to respond? how much cognitive work is needed?</li>
            <li>time: how long does it take to complete a response and resume original activity?</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The components above form <strong>the key design principles</strong> for our approach to relieving burden.
          We hypothesized that a study design that reduced each component would result in
          imroved burden.  This is exactly how our task was defined.

      <p class="blurb">
        We had an opportunity to assess the EMA system in the context of a larger
        mobile-sensing study.  In addition to EMA data collection, the larger study used the sensors
        on board each participants phone to monitor app use, sleep, physical activity,
        and other variables related to well-being.  (A detailed description of
        the larger study is here.)

      <h3 class="text-center sourceCodePro">Participants</h3>
      <p class="blurb">
        To evaluate the design of an EMA system for student emotions, we wanted
        to sample participants at the graduate and undergraduate level.  We only
        recruited those with phones running the Android platform because these allowed
        developers to build interactions that appear after the activation of the
        phone and before the lock-screen appears. Of those who participated in
        the larger study, 32 graduate and
        undergraduate students (44% Female) participated in the focus groups.

        <h3>Design an EMA study system of student
          emotion that reduces the burden of interruption, effort, and time.</h3>
        <hr>

        <h3>Two Key Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To generally reduce interruption, effort, and time, we implemented a
            <strong>lock-screen design</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            To specifically reduce the effort and time required for reporting mood and stress,
            we implemented an <strong>image-based question design</strong>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5 class="sourceCodePro">Lock-screen Design vs. Conventional EMA</h5>
        <p>
          The lock-screen design diplays a question when users activate their phones (when
          lock-screens are normally displayed).  In contrast, typical EMA systems use
          notifications to signal users that it is time to respond to a scheduled
          questionnaire.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notifications are interruptive.  They can occure while a user action is already
          in progress.  The lock-screen design avoids this by engaging users only when
          they are in transition (between actions).
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
          A notification like this could come at a bad time.  You could be absorbed
          in a time-sensitive puzzle or a critical conversation, in which case the
          messages could become a nuisance.  Instead, a question could wait on the
          lock-screen of your phone, only getting noticed when you activate it.
          This is how lock-screen systems can<span data-toggle="tooltip"
          data-placement="bottom" title="our context-and-signal contingent design
          also avoided interrupting participants at a specific level of activity,
          an accomplishment that is best described in terms of activity theory.
          While participants were interrupted at the 'action' level
          (checking the weather on the phone or looking up the definition of a
          word), we avoided interrupting them at the 'operations' level
          (well-defined, routine actions like tapping \enquote{send} on an email).
          We attribute their tolerance for frequent prompts to brevity of
          interactions and uninterrupted operations.">
          <strong>avoid interrupting</strong>.</span>  Because the
          interface for the question acts as the notification, there is no need to
          navigate to a questionnaire interface.  This is how a lock-screen system can
          <strong>reduce effort</strong>.  Responding in this system requires only
          enough <strong>time</strong> to answer a single question.
          <br>
          <br>
          I recommended that we take the lock-screen approach, and we worked with
          a commercial company called Quedget to implement the EMA
          system described above.  Our system is difficult to categorize using the
          most popular taxonomy of EMA systems.
          Here is my suggestion on an
          <span data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Signal-contingent,
          interval-contingent, and event-contingent are not orthogonal."><strong>alternative

        <h5 class="sourceCodePro">Image-based questions for quick emotion reports</h5>
        <p>
          Established mood and stress questionnaires aren't well suited for EMA.
          They're <strong>too long</strong>.  The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)
          measures both emotional valence (feeling good vs feeling bad) and arousal
          (high vs low energy), but it asks 20 questions to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          We adapted a paradigm that uses a grid of photographs to capture valence
          and arousal.  It has been validated to correlate with PANAS, but it you only need
          to <strong>select one picture instead of answering 20 questions</strong>.

                      People responded to a <strong>high volume</strong> of questions, and no one
                      in the focus groups suggested that the volume was too high.
                      In fact, some suggested that it would be better to ask even
                      more frequently:  "Yeah, the how do you feel right now and
                      what are you doing right now, that <strong>could be asked a bit more

                We speculate that the tendency users to spend the same average amount
                of time on questions of different complexity can be attributed to
                the speed afforded by the lock-screen system.  The mere ability
                to respond very quickly may have created a norm of quick responses.

                The increased burden caused some users to adapt their behaviors in various
                ways.  Others unwittingly gave inappropriate answers because of a mental
                model mismatch.

                  Response times were fast.  The average response time (from
                  presentation of the question to completing an answer) was 5.68
                  seconds.  In fact, this response time did not differ significantly
                  from the average time it took users to unlock their phones.

                  People responded to a high volume of questions, and no one
                  in the focus groups suggested that the volume was too high.
                  In fact, some suggested that it would be better to ask even
                  more frequently:  "Yeah, the how do you feel right now and
                  what are you doing right now, that could be asked a bit more
                  frequently." &mdash;p18
