          <h3>Frequent Reporting is Precious</h3>

          <!-- <p>
          Even though researchers are starting to use facial expressions, heart rate,
          and typing velocity to measure emotion, there's no better way to get the "hedonic"
          quality of someone's emotion than asking them.  There's a good reason to ask
          very frequently too.  Time patterns in emotion are a key indicator of instability
          and disordered mood (think bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder).
          Because  <span data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="More than half
          of college students felt 'overwhelming anxiety' in 2012.  That year, half reported
          greater than average or extreme levels of stress.">college students face enhanced
          risk for emotional problems</span>, we focused on measuring the time course
          of their emotions.  Doing this well is crucial from a clinical and public health
          pespective.
        </p> -->

        <p>
          Emotions occur in a variety of environments and circumstances.
          To understand the effect of these changes, we need to <strong>measure emotion
            in different contexts</strong>.  If contexts change frequently, emotion must
            be reported frequently.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's normal for emotions to fluctuate.  However, very rapid and extreme fluctuations
            can signal problems with regulating emotions (such as bipolar disorder or borderline
            personality disorder).  These <strong>insights from emotion dynamics</strong> require that
            a person report frequently enough to capture the patterns accurately.

          <h3>Frequent Reporting is Elusive</h3>
          <p>
            Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is one name for the technique of answering
            a question repeatedly over time.  It's easy to see how that experience
            can <strong>become a burden</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this project, we broke burden down into three components:
            <ul>
              <li>interruption: is focus being disrupted?</li>
              <li>effort: how many steps required to respond? how much cognitive work is needed?</li>
              <li>time: how long does it take to complete a response and resume original activity?</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            The components above form <strong>the key design principles</strong> for our approach to relieving burden.
            We hypothesized that a study design that reduced each component would result in
            imroved burden.  This is exactly how our task was defined.

              We had an opportunity to assess the EMA system in the context of a larger
              mobile-sensing study.  In addition to EMA data collection, the larger study used the sensors
              on board each participants phone to monitor app use, sleep, physical activity,
              and other variables related to well-being.  (A detailed description of

            recruited those with phones running the Android platform because these allowed
            developers to build interactions that appear after the activation of the
            phone and before the lock-screen appears. Of those who participated in
            the larger study, 32 graduate and
            undergraduate students (44% Female) participated in the focus groups.

                To generally reduce interruption, effort, and time, we implemented a
                <strong>lock-screen design</strong>.
              </li>
              <li>
                To specifically reduce the effort and time required for reporting mood and stress,
                we implemented an <strong>image-based question design</strong>.

            </ul>

          <h5 class="sourceCodePro">Lock-screen Design vs. Conventional EMA</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="blurb">
          <p>
            The lock-screen design diplays a question when users activate their phones (when
            lock-screens are normally displayed).  In contrast, typical EMA systems use
            notifications to signal users that it is time to respond to a scheduled
            questionnaire.
          </p>
          <p>
            Notifications are interruptive.  They can occure while a user action is already
            in progress.  The lock-screen design avoids this by engaging users only when
            they are in transition (between actions).
          </p>
            <!-- <p>
            A notification like this could come at a bad time.  You could be absorbed
            in a time-sensitive puzzle or a critical conversation, in which case the
            messages could become a nuisance.  Instead, a question could wait on the
            lock-screen of your phone, only getting noticed when you activate it.
            This is how lock-screen systems can<span data-toggle="tooltip"
            data-placement="bottom" title="our context-and-signal contingent design
            also avoided interrupting participants at a specific level of activity,
            an accomplishment that is best described in terms of activity theory.
            While participants were interrupted at the 'action' level
            (checking the weather on the phone or looking up the definition of a
            word), we avoided interrupting them at the 'operations' level
            (well-defined, routine actions like tapping \enquote{send} on an email).
            We attribute their tolerance for frequent prompts to brevity of
            interactions and uninterrupted operations.">
            <strong>avoid interrupting</strong>.</span>  Because the
            interface for the question acts as the notification, there is no need to
            navigate to a questionnaire interface.  This is how a lock-screen system can
            <strong>reduce effort</strong>.  Responding in this system requires only
            enough <strong>time</strong> to answer a single question.
            <br>
            <br>
            I recommended that we take the lock-screen approach, and we worked with
            a commercial company called Quedget to implement the EMA
            system described above.  Our system is difficult to categorize using the
            most popular taxonomy of EMA systems.
            Here is my suggestion on an

            Established mood and stress questionnaires aren't well suited for EMA.
            They're <strong>too long</strong>.  The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)
            measures both emotional valence (feeling good vs feeling bad) and arousal
            (high vs low energy), but it asks 20 questions to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
            We adapted a paradigm that uses a grid of photographs to capture valence
            and arousal.  It has been validated to correlate with PANAS, but it you only need
            to <strong>select one picture instead of answering 20 questions</strong>.

                  On average the users responded to the majority of question prompts,
                  in spite of the volume.  However, there were contexts in which the
                  users gave random answers.  If the question appeared while the user
                  was doing other tasks, for example, the quality of the response
                  was more likely to suffer.

                  In terms of enabling fast responses, were we victims of our own success?
                  We speculate that the tendency users to spend the same average amount
                  of time on questions of different complexity can be attributed to
                  the speed afforded by the lock-screen system.  The mere ability
                  to respond very quickly may have created a norm of quick responses.
