      How to Get Very Frequent Emotion Reporting

        <!-- <p>
          Even though researchers are starting to use facial expressions, heart rate,
          and typing velocity to measure emotion, there's no better way to get the "hedonic"
          quality of someone's emotion than asking them.  There's a good reason to ask
          very frequently too.  Time patterns in emotion are a key indicator of instability
          and disordered mood (think bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder).
          Because  <span data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="More than half
          of college students felt 'overwhelming anxiety' in 2012.  That year, half reported
          greater than average or extreme levels of stress.">college students face enhanced
          risk for emotional problems</span>, we focused on measuring the time course
          of their emotions.  Doing this well is crucial from a clinical and public health
          pespective.

        <p>
          Emotions occur in a variety of environments and circumstances.
          To understand the effect of these changes, we need to <strong>measure emotion
          in different contexts</strong>.  If contexts change frequently, emotion must
          be reported frequently.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's normal for emotions to fluctuate.  However, very rapid and extreme fluctuations
          can signal problems with regulating emotions (such as bipolar disorder or borderline
          personality disorder).  These <strong>insights from emotion dynamics</strong> require that
          a person report frequently enough to capture the patterns accurately.
        </p>
        <h3>Frequency is Elusive</h3>
        <p>
          Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is one name for the technique of answering
          a question repeatedly over time.  It's easy to see how that experience
          can become a burden.  For this project, we broke burden down into three components:
          <ul>
            <li>interruption: is focus being disrupted?</li>
            <li>effort: how many steps required to respond? how much cognitive work is needed?</li>
            <li>time: how long does it take to complete a response and resume original activity?</li>
          </ul>
          These components form the key design principles for our approach to relieving burden.
          We hypothesized that a study design that reduced each component would result in
          imroved burden.  This is exactly how our task was defined.
