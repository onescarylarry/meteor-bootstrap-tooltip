      <h3 class=text-center>Background</h3>
      <p class="blurb">
        When browsing research articles, is it easy to tell which ones made a splash outside of the research community?  Was there widespread social commentary, policy change, or controversy in response to the research?  Current discovery tools reveal little about the full range of social responses.  PostScholar poses a solution that helps researchers survey the broader response to research reports when deciding what to explore more deeply.

      <h3 class=text-center>The Shortcomings of Citations</h3>

          <p class="blurb">
            The traditional dialog carried out through research publications is sluggish.  The process of publication alone can add a year or more between one article and a response in a subsequent article.  This makes citation chains a lagging indicator of reactions.  Yet they are still a prevailing tool for finding dialog within a research domain.
            <br>
            Research can rapidly gain attention in the popular press.  It can activate people in social media.  The collection of these responses has been referred to as altmetrics.

      <h3 class=text-center>Cross purposes in altmetrics?</h3>
      <p class="blurb">
        Companies aggregate and organize this data so that they can audit researchers and institutions in terms of social impact.  It’s a prominent aspect of grantsmanship and funding in general.  So, when counting how many times an article has been shared on Facebook or mentioned on Twitter, they are answering a different question:  what is the magnitude of this article’s social impact?
        <br>
        Compare this question to what researchers want to know while exploring what scholars have learned (Schneiderman?).  How can I relate this to my own work?  What do others think it’s important to focus on?  Should I expand my perspective?  The content of social media posts are more useful than a count of those posts.  I used secondary research to find principles that could guide our ideation.

      <h3 class=text-center>Preference for Single Interface</h3>

          <p class="blurb">
            Researchers prefer using a single interface, even a single search box when conducting searches.  This preference has decreased the use of specific databases the rise of discovery systems, which present one interface for searching across collections and data types.  Principle: avoid solving the problem by adding a new interface.
            <br>
            The prevailing mental model for how search should work has been highly influenced by search engines, like Google’s.  This explains migration toward single search boxes and the prominence of Google Scholar.  Principle: embed solution within prevailing mental model (Google Scholar).
