      <p class="blurb">
        Problem: Sometimes an academic article can lead an exciting public life, but it might be hard
        to tell when it shows up in your search results.
      </p>
      <p class="blurb">
        To illustrate the problem, let's take a scandal about <strong>whether spinach really is an
        outstanding source of iron</strong>. TJ Hamblin debunked this myth by reporting this
        realization, made by German chemists in the 1930s: a misplaced decimal had caused a "tenfold
        overestimate" of iron levels in spinach!
      <p class="blurb">
        Hablin's warning about the lasting public damage done by this kind of carelessness was
        cited for decades until Hamblin's account was itself <strong>debunked</strong>.  There
        was no misplaced decimal, only a chain of scandalously poor citation checking.

                      <strong>Citation chains are a lagging indicator</strong>&mdash;
                      The traditional dialog carried out through research publications
                      is sluggish.  The process of publication alone can add a year
                      or more between one article and a response in a subsequent article.

                      <strong>Access is difficult</strong>&mdash;Researchers with no institutional
                      affiliations, especially in developing nations, may have no
                      lawful access to services.  Those who do must cope with authentication
                      steps, remain on an institutional network, or use a proxy for access.

                    <p>
                      <strong>Interface proliferation</strong>&mdash;Researchers had trouble
                      using multiple interfaces to search multiple databases.  The mental model
                      for how search should work has been highly influenced by the Google
                      search engine.  This explains why discovery systems migrated toward
                      single search boxes and why Google Scholar is a prominent tool in all
                      reviewed search behaviors.

                  These researchers are making sense of unfamiliar information, and they explore
                  widely to gain perspective.  In contrast, faculty and experienced researchers search
                  <em>exclusively</em>, because they know what they want and can work faster
                  with a higher signal-to-noise ratio.  Perceiving the social activity of an article
                  fits in well with the discovery approach that less experienced researchers engage in.

                On average the users responded to the majority of question prompts,
                in spite of the volume.  However, there were contexts in which the
                users gave random answers.  If the question appeared while the user
                was doing other tasks, for example, the quality of the response
                was more likely to suffer.

                In terms of enabling fast responses, were we victims of our own success?
                We speculate that the tendency users to spend the same average amount
                of time on questions of different complexity can be attributed to
                the speed afforded by the lock-screen system.  The mere ability
                to respond very quickly may have created a norm of quick responses.

                    Response times were fast.  The average response time (from
                    presentation of the question to completing an answer) was 5.68
                    seconds.  In fact, this response time did not differ significantly
                    from the average time it took users to unlock their phones.

                    People responded to a high volume of questions, and no one
                    in the focus groups suggested that the volume was too high.
                    In fact, some suggested that it would be better to ask even
                    more frequently:  "Yeah, the how do you feel right now and
                    what are you doing right now, that could be asked a bit more
                    frequently." &mdash;p18

                While some participants enjoyed these image-based questions and
                used them successfully, others expressed <strong>problems mapping</strong> their
                emotions onto the images.

                Other people complained that there were too many images.  This
                sentiment revealed problems with the <strong>mental

                A 4 x 4 grid of discrete representations of valence and arousal
                presents users with a 16-item search task, which carries a significant
                <strong>cognitive load</strong>.  Randomization of these images
                compromises the <strong>memorability</strong>
                of the interface.

              On average the users responded to the majority of question prompts,
              in spite of the volume.  However, there were contexts in which the
              users gave random answers.  If the question appeared while the user
              was doing other tasks, for example, the quality of the response
              was more likely to suffer.

            <p>
              In terms of enabling fast responses, were we victims of our own success?
              We speculate that the tendency users to spend the same average amount
              of time on questions of different complexity can be attributed to
              the speed afforded by the lock-screen system.  The mere ability
              to respond very quickly may have created a norm of quick responses.

              The increased burden caused some users to adapt their behaviors in various
              ways.  Others unwittingly gave inappropriate answers because of a mental
              model mismatch.
