          <strong>The Inspiration</strong>
          <br>
          In 2015 on "This American Life", comedian Lindy West interviewed her harasser, a stranger who had played
          tricks on her, like writing her a hurtful letter, as her father, who had recently died.  In the interview,
          the man expressed profound regret for everything he had done to West, and she found empathy for him in
          his circumstances.
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Our Motive</strong>
          <br>
          Because empathy is a tenet of human-centered design, but difficult to
          extend to people seen as cruel, we chose to study Kotaku in Action, an online community whose
          reputation includes extreme harassment.  We spoke
          with 13 people from this community.
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>The Background of KiA</strong>
          <br>
          In 2014 the gamer community became suspicious of video game journalists, some of whom had accused
          gamers of mysogeny and even announced the end of the gamer community as an important demographic.
          In response, a social movement called GamerGate formed.

          Gamergaters opposed both prominent journalists and
          feminists in the video game industry.  Brianna Wu and other women received death threats and had their
          private information broadcast publicly (a practice known as Doxxing).  Kotaku In Action calls itself
          the official subreddit of GamerGate, and its members are therefore suspected of very nasty behavior.

        <h5>Description of Interests by Informants</h5>
        <p>
          When we asked participants, they told us that interests centered around
          game culture, free speech, ethics in journalism, and the overreach of
          PC culture.
        </p>
        <h5>Behavioral Evidence</h5>
        <div>
          Using the Reddit API, we sampled 1000 comments and then looked at what
          other subreddits those commenters posted on.  The table on the right
          shows the top 10 subreddits we found, and this give us some insight
          into what topics have popular appeal in the KiA community.
          <br>
          <br>
          Current events, gender, and games all figured prominently in the top
          ten subreddits.  Posting in r/MensRights suggests explicit opposition
           to feminism, which has no intrinsic connection with ethics in games
          journalism.  So any aggressive online tactics are liable to reflect
          antipathy towards feminists.

          <p class="blurb">
            Prevalence of harassers in the community cannot be quantified.  A
            common problem identifying hate groups is the presence
            of factions who are not bigoted [Gerstenfeld 2013].  People on both
             sides of the debate have been harassed.
            <br>
            It seems likely that perpetrators are present, but harassment doesn't
            appear to be a community goal.  Our conclusion:
            KiA is not a viper’s nest, though there are probably vipers in the nest.

Such calls were rejected on the grounds that rebranding would divide the community and trolls would simply follow the movement and smear it under the new tag. -->
