      <h3 class=text-center>Background</h3>
      <p class="blurb">
        In 2015 on "This American Life", comedian Lindy West interviewed her harasser, a stranger who had played
        tricks on her, like writing her a hurtful letter, as her father, who had recently died.  In the interview,
        the man expressed profound regret for everything he had done to West, and she found empathy for him in
        his circumstances.  Because empathy is a tenet of human-centered design, but difficult to
        extend to people seen as cruel, we chose to study Kotaku in Action, an online community whose
        reputation includes extreme harassment.
        <br>
        <br>
        In 2014 the gamer community became suspicious of video game journalists, some of whom had accused
        gamers of mysogeny and even announced the end of the gamer community as an important demographic.
        In response, a social movement called GamerGate formed.  Gamergaters opposed both prominent journalists and
        feminists in the video game industry.  Zoe Quinn and other women received death threats and had their
        private information broadcast publicly (a practice known as Doxxing).  Kotaku In Action calls itself
        the official subreddit of GamerGate, and its members are suspected of very nasty behavior.  We spoke
        with 13 people from this community.

          Target characteristics:
          we wanted to include both members, moderators, and multiple genders.
          We expected members and moderators to have distinct views on how the
          community should operate.  Because core questions about the community
          are related to gender, we wanted to include more than one gender.
          Some participants did not wish to report age or other demographic data,
          so some information is missing from the table.

        <hr>
        <h5>Description of Interests by Informants</h5>
        <p>
          When we asked participants, they told us that interests centered around
          game culture, free speech, ethics in journalism, and the overreach of
          PC culture.
        </p>
        <h5>Behavioral Evidence</h5>
        <div>
          Using the Reddit API, we sampled 1000 comments and then looked at what
          other subreddits those commenters posted on.  The table on the right
          shows the top 10 subreddits we found, and this give us some insight
          into what topics have popular appeal in the KiA community.
          <br>
          <br>
          Current events, gender, and games all figured prominently in the top
          ten subreddits.  Posting in r/MensRights suggests explicit opposition
           to feminism, which has no intrinsic connection with ethics in games
          journalism.  So any aggressive online tactics are liable to reflect
          antipathy towards feminists.

          <p class="blurb">
            Prevalence of harassers in the community cannot be quantified.  A
            common problem identifying hate groups is the presence
            of factions who are not bigoted [Gerstenfeld 2013].  People on both
             sides of the debate have been harassed.
            <br>
            It seems likely that perpetrators are present, but harassment doesn't
            appear to be a community goal.  Our conclusion:
            KiA is not a viper’s nest, though there are probably vipers in the nest.
