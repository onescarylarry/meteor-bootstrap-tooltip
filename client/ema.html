      How to relieve the hassle of being asked ten times per day about your

        <p>
          Asking is important.  Even though emotion researchers are starting to use facial
          expressions, heart rate,
          and typing velocity to measure emotion, there's no better way to get the subjective
          quality of someone's emotion than asking them.  There's a good reason to ask
          very frequently too.  Time patterns in emotion are a key indicator of instability
          and disordered mood (think bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder).
          Because  <span data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="More than half
          of college students felt 'overwhelming anxiety' in 2012.  That year, half reported

          risk for emotional problems</span>, we focused on measuring the time course
          of their emotions.  Doing this well is crucial from a clinical and public health
          pespective.

        <h5 class="sourceCodePro">The EMA burden</h5>
        <p>
          Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is one name for the technique of answering
          a question repeatedly over time.  It's easy to see how that experience
          can become a burden.  For this project, we broke burden down into three components:
          <ul>
            <li>interruption: is focus being disrupted?</li>
            <li>effort: how many steps required to respond? how much cognitive work is needed?</li>
            <li>time: how long does it take to complete a response and resume original activity?</li>
          </ul>
          These components form the key design principles for our approach to relieving burden.
          We hypothesized that a study design that reduced each component would result in
          imroved burden.  This is exactly how our task was defined.

        <h5 class="sourceCodePro">Conventional notification-based EMA vs. Lock-screen</h5>
        <p>
          How do you know when it's time to answer a question?  Conventional
          notification-based EMA systems message you on channels like email or SMS, telling
          you that it's time to go to the tool you use for answering questions.  That
          could entail opening a web-page or an app.
        </p>
        <p>
          A notification like this could come at a bad time.  You could be absorbed
          in a time-sensitive puzzle or a critical conversation, in which case the
          messages could become a nuisance.  Instead, a question could wait on the
          lock-screen of your phone, only getting noticed when you activate it.
          This is how lock-screen systems can<span data-toggle="tooltip"
          data-placement="bottom" title="our context-and-signal contingent design
          also avoided interrupting participants at a specific level of activity,
          an accomplishment that is best described in terms of activity theory.
          While participants were interrupted at the 'action' level
          (checking the weather on the phone or looking up the definition of a
          word), we avoided interrupting them at the 'operations' level
          (well-defined, routine actions like tapping \enquote{send} on an email).
          We attribute their tolerance for frequent prompts to brevity of
          interactions and uninterrupted operations.">
          <strong>avoid interrupting</strong>.</span>  Because the
          interface for the question acts as the notification, there is no need to
          navigate to a questionnaire interface.  This is how a lock-screen system can
          <strong>reduce effort</strong>.  Responding in this system requires only
          enough <strong>time</strong> to answer a single question.
          <br>
          <br>
          I recommended that we take the lock-screen approach, and we worked with
          a commercial company called Quedget to implement the EMA
          system described above.  Our system is difficult to categorize using the
          most popular taxonomy of EMA systems.
          Here is my suggestion on an

          interval-contingent, and event-contingent are not orthogonal."><strong>alternative

        <h5 class="sourceCodePro">Image-based questions to assess mood and stress</h5>
        <p>
          Traditional mood and stress questions have been well established in experimental
          and clinical literature.  The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)
          measures both emotional valence (feeling good vs feeling bad) and activation
          (high vs low energy), but it asks 20 questions to do so.  Attempting to
          accomplish the same thing with a single question, researchers at Cornell developed
          the Photographic Affect Meter (PAM).  To use it, you just choose
          the picture that best matches your mood from a 4 x 4 grid.  Similar to PAM is
          the Mobile Stress Meter (MSM), which asks you to choose from a 4 x 4 grid to
          express how much stress you are feeling.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were many emotion question alternatives to choose from.  I recommended
          that we use PAM and MSM for three reasons.
          <ol>
            <li>They are brief</li>
            <li>They have not yet been fully assessed qualitatively in a pilot study</li>
            <li>
              We would be matching the data collection of three other sites in a
              <span data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="We did this pilot
              as part of a multi-site consortium of universities, including CMU, Cornell,
              and Dartmouth.  Each of these three used PAM."><strong>consortium

        <hr>
        <h5 class="sourceCodePro">Adapting image-based questions for lock-screen system</h5>
        <p>
          Putting interfaces on a lock-screen increases the risk of error through
          inadvertent action.  If the emotion question becomes active on the display
          while the phone is in your pocket, you could easily tap one of the response
          choices without knowing it.  One solution is to accept only drag and drop
          gestures, which far less likely to happen accidentally.
        </p>
        <p>
          While adapting PAM and PSM, I used guerilla validation to test some of
          my assumptions.  For example, I assumed that
          dragging the selected image to a target area would be preferable to
          dragging a target object to a selected image.  When colleagues tried both
          interactions on a
          low fidelity prototype, they touched the target object only after
          choosing the image.
          This requires a glance to locate the image, a glance to locate the object and
          a glance to locate the image a second time.  Dragging the target image
          obviates the final glance.

        We had an opportunity to assess the EMA system in the context of a larger
        mobile-sensing study.  In addition to EMA data collection, the larger study used the sensors
        on board each participants phone to monitor app use, sleep, physical activity,
        and other variables related to well-being.  (A detailed description of
        the larger study is here.)

        To evaluate the design of an EMA system for student emotions, we wanted
        to sample participants at the graduate and undergraduate level.  We only
        recruited those with phones running the Android platform because these allowed
        developers to build interactions that appear after the activation of the
        phone and before the lock-screen appears. Of those who participated in
        the larger study, 32 graduate and
        undergraduate students (44% Female) participated in the focus groups.
