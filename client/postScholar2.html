        <strong>Problem</strong>
        <br>
        When searching for academic articles, how do you know which ones made a splash
        outside of the research community?  An academic article can lead an exciting public life,
        but it might be hard to tell by looking at your search results.

        For example, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788">this article</a>
        reports how Facebook manipulated the emotions of its users.  According to Altmetric,
        this article was mentioned by nearly
        4000 twitter users.  It was cited in 413 stories from 229 news outlets, such as Forbes.

        <strong>Solution</strong>
        <br>
        I used secondary research to chart the common ways people search for articles
        and to see if a solution to this problem would be useful to anyone.  After targeting
        a segment of the research population, I worked on a team to design and build a prototype.
        Here is a summary of our process and findings.

                      <strong>Citation chains are a lagging indicator</strong>&mdash;
                      The traditional dialog carried out through research publications
                      is sluggish.  The process of publication alone can add a year
                      or more between one article and a response in a subsequent article.

                      <strong>Access is difficult</strong>&mdash;Researchers with no institutional
                      affiliations, especially in developing nations, may have no
                      lawful access to services.  Those who do must cope with authentication
                      steps, remain on an institutional network, or use a proxy for access.

                    <p>
                      <strong>Interface proliferation</strong>&mdash;Researchers had trouble
                      using multiple interfaces to search multiple databases.  The mental model
                      for how search should work has been highly influenced by the Google
                      search engine.  This explains why discovery systems migrated toward
                      single search boxes and why Google Scholar is a prominent tool in all
                      reviewed search behaviors.

                  These researchers are making sense of unfamiliar information, and they explore
                  widely to gain perspective.  In contrast, faculty and experienced researchers search
                  <em>exclusively</em>, because they know what they want and can work faster
                  with a higher signal-to-noise ratio.  Perceiving the social activity of an article
                  fits in well with the discovery approach that less experienced researchers engage in.

                Google and Google Scholar embody the preeminent mental models for search.  In the convention of Google Scholar, anchor tags appear at the bottom of each record.

                Because the social signal is exposed for all records in a search result, the social information can be used as part of the exploration process.

              On average the users responded to the majority of question prompts,
              in spite of the volume.  However, there were contexts in which the
              users gave random answers.  If the question appeared while the user
              was doing other tasks, for example, the quality of the response
              was more likely to suffer.

              'I was driving, and I was trying to change the song on my phone,
              and then the question popped up, but then it was really awkward
              trying not to get into an accident, but skip the question...' &mdash;P16

              In terms of enabling fast responses, were we victims of our own success?
              We speculate that the tendency users to spend the same average amount
              of time on questions of different complexity can be attributed to
              the speed afforded by the lock-screen system.  The mere ability
              to respond very quickly may have created a norm of quick responses.
